## Assumptions/Limitations


## Original Problem Statement

In this code test, you are asked to implement a static web page, following a UX/UI
wireframe as specified in the attached Figma file. This wireframe, as you will see,
contains a table with sorting and grouping functionality.
These are the guidelines you are asked to follow:
1. The web page can be static, meaning that you donâ€™t need to build a backend,
but can simply use static data to display. If you choose to build a backend too,
that would be a bonus.
2. Use React and Typescript. You can use whatever packages or libraries you like.
Feel free to use or be inspired by this resource: https://www.material-reacttable.com/docs/examples/aggregation-and-grouping
3. Publish your final code in a GitHub repository that you can share with us. Do
not make the repository public. It should be kept private.
4. Share your result in one of the two following ways. We recommend option a.
a. It is encouraged to deploy your code on some deployment service, so
that you can share a live version of the web page that we can view and
interact with. Do not make this deployment of the web page public. It
should be kept private.
b. You can also share your code as-is, but in that case, you should make
sure to provide detailed instructions for us to run it ourselves on a local
environment.
5. You have 1 week to finish the code test, counting from when you received
these instructions. Please let us know if you would like to have more time.
There are 4 aspects that we are particularly interested in when evaluating your code:
1. How well you can follow a UX/UI wireframe, in terms of both look-and-feel as
well as functionality
2. Your proficiency in React as a framework and Typescript as a language
3. Your ability to work independently
4. Your strengths as a programmer â€“ make sure to showcase your strengths!
You cannot reuse what youâ€™ve built for this code test for other purposes than this
internship application. This means, for example, that you cannot publish what youâ€™ve
built to your public GitHub repository or use in another job application.
